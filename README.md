TOPIC: Heart Rate Zone Calculation.
Objective: Determine heart rate zones based on age and resting heart rate to guide exercise intensity (e.g., fat-burning, cardio, or peak zones).
Formula: The Karvonen formula or a similar heart rate calculation method.
Learning Goals:
Conditional logic for categorizing heart rate zones.
Working with formulas to derive different categories based on input.
Reinforces logical segmentation of health metrics.
Example Prompt:
Write a program that takes a user’s age and resting heart rate, then calculates their maximum heart rate and divides it into different exercise intensity zones (fat-burning, aerobic, anaerobic). Print the heart rate ranges for each zone and give a recommendation based on the user’s fitness goal.
Explanation:
Calculate MHR and HRR:

Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is estimated using the formula 220 - age.
Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) is the difference between MHR and resting heart rate.
Define Zone Percentages:

Percentages for fat-burning, aerobic, and anaerobic zones are defined.
Calculate Zone Ranges:
Heart rate ranges for each zone are calculated based on HRR and zone percentages.
Print Zone Ranges:

The calculated ranges are printed in a user-friendly format.
Provide a Recommendation:

Based on the user's fitness goal, a specific zone recommendation is given.
Note:
This program provides a general guideline and may not be suitable for everyone.
It's always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise regimen.  
Other factors like fitness level and specific health conditions can influence heart rate zones.
This program effectively demonstrates the use of conditional logic and formula-based calculations to provide personalized fitness recommendations.
